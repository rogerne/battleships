A simple game of battleships
This is a version of the classic kids game Battleships written in Ruby that can be played in the Windows cmd line.  If like me your windows 10 command line doesn't display colours then please look at this excellent YouTube clip which shows you how to solve this problem in about 2 minutes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9j25pMINs or search for Color display error in Terminal | Terminal Görünüm sorunu - YouTube.
